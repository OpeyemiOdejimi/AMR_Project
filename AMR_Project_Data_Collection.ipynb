    "### 1. Background and Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a growing public health threat in Nigeria, with increasing reports of multidrug-resistant pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Although microbiology laboratories across Nigeria routinely generate antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) data, these data are often fragmented, non-standardized, and under-utilized for predictive surveillance and early warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to collect anonymized laboratory AMR data to develop machine learning and AI-based tools that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detect resistance patterns,\n",
    "* Predict emerging resistance trends,\n",
    "* Support national AMR surveillance and policy trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aligns with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nigeria's [National Action Plan on AMR(NAP 2024-2028)](https://ncdc.gov.ng/news/524/press-release%3A-national-amr-stakeholders-hold-first-quarter-meeting)\n",
